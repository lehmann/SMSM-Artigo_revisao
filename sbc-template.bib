abstract="Technological advances in position aware devices increase the availability of tracking data of everyday objects such as animals, vehicles, people or football players. We propose a geographic data mining approach to detect generic aggregation patterns such as flocking behaviour and convergence in geospatial lifeline data. Our approach considers the object's motion properties in an analytical space as well as spatial constraints of the object's lifelines in geographic space. We discuss the geometric properties of the formalised patterns with respect to their efficient computation.",

abstract="Points are dimensionless geometric elements often employed by geographic information systems to model a range of real-world objects such as people and vehicles. Many analytical tools have been developed for finding and validating certain patterns of static points such as clustering. In this paper, we present our preliminary efforts to develop statistical methods for analyzing patterns of moving points whose locations are tracked at equal intervals of time. Focus is placed on simple descriptive statistics---rather than more sophisticated inferential statistics---useful for detecting a tendency of two or more points to move in some coordinated fashion. A major implication of this paper is that statistical analysis complements spatial data query and modeling with respect to dynamics of sets of point-like objects in a way that potentially interrelated subsets are screened.",

abstract="During the last decade, the domain of mobility data mining has emerged providing many effective methods for the discovery of intuitive patterns representing collective behavior of trajectories of moving objects. Although a few real-world trajectory datasets have been made available recently, these are not sufficient for experimentally evaluating the various proposals, therefore, researchers look to synthetic trajectory generators. This case is problematic because, on the one hand, real datasets are usually small, which compromises scalability experiments, and, on the other hand, synthetic dataset generators have not been designed to produce mobility pattern driven trajectories. Motivated by this observation, we present Hermoupolis, an effective generator of synthetic trajectories of moving objects that has the main objective that the resulting datasets support various types of mobility patterns (clusters, flocks, convoys, etc.), as such producing datasets with available ground truth information.",
